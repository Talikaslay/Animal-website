        Capybaras, the world's largest rodents, are semi-aquatic herbivores that thrive in South American wetlands. They are
        known for their large, barrel-shaped bodies, coarse brown fur, and webbed feet, making them excellent swimmers.
        Capybaras typically live in groups and are quite social, often seen basking in the sun or relaxing in shallow water.</p>
